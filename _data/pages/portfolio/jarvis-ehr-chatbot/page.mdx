# Jarvis EHR Chatbot

## Problem Overview:

Current electronic medical records (EMR) systems like EPIC, Cerner, MEDITECH, AthenaHealth use a grid based view of information in patient files. A lot of categories, tables and information are crammed into a single page view, requiring users (which are primarily healthcare providers) to scan through a lot of information before finding the information they need.

Jarvis is a chat based AI feature designed to enhance EMR systems. It enables natural language interactions between healthcare professionals and the EMR software, streamlining data access, updates, and inquiries, thereby improving productivity and reducing provider errors.

## Objectives:

To improve overall efficiency of chart review by healthcare professionals, by using a conversational format with a chatbot assistant.

## Success Metrics:

-   Find accurate and relevant information in the fewest possible questions.
-   Improve provider satisfaction and reduce errors while performing chart review.

## Personas

The primary target users are healthcare professionals who need to reference a medical chart for quick inquiries. It could be a physician who is covering on the weekend and needs specific lab results for a post-operative patient. Or a nurse who needs to find when the last dose of pain medication was administered. The goal is to reduce the number of clicks and the time spent in locating the information by having a AI powered chatbot.

## Features for MVP/ User stories

P0/ MVP

-   As a provider looking for specific information, I want to be able to type a question related to the medical chart and receive accurate information within the chat.
-   As a provider looking for details, I want to see the specific chart page where the information was retrieved from by the chatbot.

P1/ Medium Priority

-   As a provider new to a patient chart, I want to get a summary of the patientâ€™s medical history as part of a conversation with the chatbot.
-   As a provider, I want to be able to view comparative reports or graphs of lab results, vitals and medications.

P2 / Advanced Features or Enhancements

-   As a provider, I want to be able to update records through conversational inputs.

## Future Features

-   Offer symptom checking and triage guidance to support initial patient assessments in fast paced patient environments
-   Assist with medical coding for billing based on information entered in the chart
-   Adding support for voice input/output to enable hands-free interaction with the chatbot will be particularly useful in clinical settings
