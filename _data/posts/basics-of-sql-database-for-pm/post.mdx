# Basics of SQL Databases for Product Managers

As a product manager, having a foundational understanding of SQL and databases is indispensable. It not only helps in making data-driven decisions but also facilitates effective communication with your development team. In this blog, we'll explore the basics of SQL databases using SQLite, an accessible database system perfect for learning SQL due to its simplicity and ease of setup.

### What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate databases. It allows you to query, update, and organize data in a database, making it an essential skill for anyone involved in data analysis or management.

### Why SQLite?

SQLite is a lightweight, file-based database management system. It's embedded into the end program, requiring minimal setup, which makes it ideal for development, testing, and smaller client applications.

### Creating a Sample Database

Let's start by creating a sample database that a product manager might use to track product inventory and sales. We'll use SQLite due to its simplicity. Here's a sample table schema for `Products`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Products (
    ProductID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductName TEXT NOT NULL,
    Price REAL NOT NULL,
    QuantityInStock INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    LastRestocked DATE
);
```

This table includes:

-   `ProductID`: a unique identifier for each product.
-   `ProductName`: the name of the product.
-   `Price`: the price of the product.
-   `QuantityInStock`: the current stock quantity, defaulting to 0 if not specified.
-   `LastRestocked`: the last date the product was restocked, which can be null if it's never been restocked.

### Basic CRUD Operations

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations you can perform on database data.

#### Create

Inserting data into the `Products` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO Products (ProductName, Price, QuantityInStock, LastRestocked)
VALUES ('Example Product', 19.99, 50, '2023-04-01');
```

#### Read

Querying data from the table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM Products;
SELECT ProductName, Price FROM Products WHERE QuantityInStock > 0;
```

#### Update

Updating data in the table:

```sql
UPDATE Products
SET Price = 29.99, LastRestocked = '2023-04-19'
WHERE ProductID = 1;
```

#### Delete

Deleting data from the table:

```sql
DELETE FROM Products WHERE ProductID = 1;
```

### Medium Complexity SQL

Now let's combine multiple concepts such as joins, subqueries, group by, and order by clauses.

#### Joins

Suppose we also have a `Sales` table that tracks each product sold:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    SaleID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INTEGER,
    SaleDate DATE,
    Quantity INTEGER,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID)
);
```

To see a report of products and their sales, we can perform a join:

```sql
SELECT p.ProductName, s.SaleDate, s.Quantity
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
WHERE s.SaleDate >= '2023-01-01';
```

#### Subquery

Find the names of products that have sold more than the average quantity sold:

```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE ProductID IN (
    SELECT ProductID
    FROM Sales
    GROUP BY ProductID
    HAVING AVG(Quantity) > (SELECT AVG(Quantity) FROM Sales)
);
```

#### Group By and Order By

Grouping the sales by product and ordering by the total quantity sold:

```sql
SELECT p.ProductName, SUM(s.Quantity) AS TotalSold
FROM Sales s
JOIN Products p ON s.ProductID = p.ProductID
GROUP BY s.ProductID
ORDER BY TotalSold DESC;
```

### Conclusion

For product managers, understanding how to manipulate and retrieve data using SQL can significantly impact your ability to make informed decisions and communicate effectively with your team. Starting with SQLite is a practical way to gain these skills due to its simplicity and ease of integration into various applications.
